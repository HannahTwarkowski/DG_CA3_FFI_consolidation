# DG_CA3_FFI_consolidation
This repository contains scripts (MATLAB, 2018a and higher) used in our study of hippocampal DG-CA3 feed-forward inihibition in memory consolidation (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445117 )
It includes the pipeline to filter temporal & spatial signals from 1photon-calcium imaging data in CA1 and ACC as well as the calculation of A&C neurons (jaccard similarity index). Data were extracted with CNMF-E (Zhou et al, 2018). Example data are provided. Scripts used to extract calcium event frequencies and cross-correlation are short scripts of basic MATLAB functions and can be made available upon request to HTwarkowski@gmail.com.
